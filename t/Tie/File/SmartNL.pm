File::SmartNL - slurp text files no matter the NL sequence

  use File::SmartNL

  $data          = File::SmartNL->smart_nl($data)
  $data          = File::SmartNL->fin( $file_name, {@options} )

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 The NL Story

Different operating systems have different sequences for new-lines.
Historically when computers where first being born, 
one of the mainstays was the teletype. 
The teletype understood L<ASCII|http:://ascii.computerdiamonds.com>.
The teletype was an automated typewriter that would perform a 
carriage return when it received an ASCII Carriage Return (CR), \015,  character
and a new line when it received a Line Feed (LF), \012 character.

After some time came Unix. Unix had a tty driver that had a raw mode that
sent data unprocessed to a teletype and a cooked mode that performed all
kinds of translations and manipulations. Unix stored data internally using
a single NL character at the ends of lines. The tty driver in the cooked
mode would translate the NL character to a CR,LF sequence. 
When driving a teletype, the physicall action of performing a carriage
return took some time. By always putting the CR before the LF, the
teletype would actually still be performing a carriage return when it
received the LF and started a line feed.

After some time came DOS. Since the tty driver is actually one of the largest
peices of code for UNIX and DOS needed to run in very cramp space,
the DOS designers decided, that instead of writing a tailored down tty driver,
they would stored a CR,LF in the internal memory. Data internally would be
either 'text' data or 'binary' data.

Needless to say, after many years and many operating systems about every
conceivable method of storing new lines may be found amoung the various
operating systems.
This greatly complicates moving files from one operating system to
another operating system.

The smart NL methods in this package are designed to take any combination
of CR and NL and translate it into the special NL seqeunce used on the
site operating system. Thus, by using these methods, the messy problem of 
moving files between operating systems is mostly hidden in these methods.
The one thing not hidden is that the methods need to know if the data is
'text' data or 'binary' data. Normally, the assume the data is 'text' and
are overriden by setting the 'binary' option.

The methods in the C<File::SmartNL> package are designed to support the
L<C<Test::STDmaker>|Test::STDmaker> and 
the L<C<ExtUtils::SVDmaker>|ExtUtils::SVDmaker> packages.
These packages generate test scripts and CPAN distribution files
that must be portable between operating systems.
Since C<File::SmartNL> is a separate package, the methods
may be used elsewhere.

Note that Perl 5.6 introduced a built-in smart nl functionality as an IO discipline :crlf.
See I<Programming Perl> by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen and Jon Orwant,
page 754, Chapter 29: Functions, open function.
For Perl 5.6 or above, the :crlf IO discipline may be preferable over the
smart_nl method of this package.
However, when moving code from one operating system to another system,
there will be target operating systems for the near and probable far future
that have not upgraded to Perl 5.6.

=head2 System Overview

The "File::SmartNL" module is used to support the expansion of 
the "Test" module by the "Test::Tech" module as follows::

  File::Load
     File::SmartNL
         Test::Tech

The "Test::Tech" module is the foundation of the 2167A bundle that
includes the L<C<Test::STDmaker>|Test::STDmaker> and 
L<C<ExtUtils::SVDmaker>|ExtUtils::SVDmaker> modules.
The focus of the "File::SmartNL" is the support of these other
modules.
In all likehood, any revisions will maintain backwards compatibility
with previous revisions.
However, support and the performance of the 
L<C<Test::STDmaker>|Test::STDmaker> and 
L<C<ExtUtils::SVDmaker>|ExtUtils::SVDmaker> packages has
priority over backwards compatibility.

=head1 METHODs

=head2 fin fout method

  $data = File::SmartNL->fin( $file_name, {@options} )
  $success = File::SmartNL->fout($file_name, $data, {@options})

Different operating systems have different new line sequences. Microsoft uses
\015\012 for text file, \012 for binary files, Macs \015 and Unix 012.  
Perl adapts to the operating system and uses \n as a logical new line.
The \015 is the L<ASCII|http://ascii.computerdiamonds.com> Carraige Return (CR)
character and the \012 is the L<ASCII|http://ascii.computerdiamonds.com> Line
Feed character.

The I<fin> method will translate any CR LF combination into the logical Perl
\n character. Normally I<fout> will use the Perl \n character. 
In other words I<fout> uses the CR LF combination appropriate of the operating
system and file type.
However supplying the option I<{binary => 1}> directs I<fout> to use binary mode and output the
CR LF raw without any translation.

By using the I<fin> and I<fout> methods, text files may be freely exchanged between
operating systems without any other processing. For example,

 ==> my $text = "=head1 Title Page\n\nSoftware Version Description\n\nfor\n\n";
 ==> File::SmartNL->fout( 'test.pm', $text, {binary => 1} );
 ==> File::SmartNL->fin( 'test.pm' );

 =head1 Title Page\n\nSoftware Version Description\n\nfor\n\n

 ==> my $text = "=head1 Title Page\r\n\r\nSoftware Version Description\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n";
 ==> File::SmartNL->fout( 'test.pm', $text, {binary => 1} );
 ==> File::SmartNL->fin( 'test.pm' );

=head2 smart_nl method

  $data = File::SmartNL->smart_nl( $data  )

Different operating systems have different new line sequences. Microsoft uses
\015\012 for text file, \012 for binary files, Macs \015 and Unix \012.  
Perl adapts to the operating system and uses \n as a logical new line.
The \015 is the L<ASCII|http://ascii.computerdiamonds.com> Carraige Return (CR)
character and the \012 is the L<ASCII|http://ascii.computerdiamonds.com> Line
Feed (LF) character.

The I<fin> method will translate any CR LF combination into the logical Perl
\n character. Normally I<fout> will use the Perl \n character. 
In other words I<fout> uses the CR LF combination appropriate for the operating
system and file type or device.
However supplying the option I<{binary => 1}> directs I<fout> to use binary mode and outputs 
CRs and LFs raw without any translation.

Perl 5.6 introduced a built-in smart nl functionality as an IO discipline :crlf.
See I<Programming Perl> by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen and Jon Orwant,
page 754, Chapter 29: Functions, open function.
For Perl 5.6 or above, the :crlf IO discipline my be preferable over the
smart_nl method of this package.

An example of the smart_nl method follows:

 ==> $text

 "line1\015\012line2\012\015line3\012line4\015"

 ==> File::SmartNL->smart_nl( $text )

 "line1\nline2\nline3\nline4\n"
