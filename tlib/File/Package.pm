=head1 NAME

File::Package - test load a program module with a package of the same name

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ##########
 # Subroutine interface
 #
 use File::Package qw( is_package_loaded, load_package)

 $package = is_package_loaded($package)
 $error   = load_package($package)
 $error   = load_package($package, @import)

 ##########
 # Class Interface
 # 
 use File::Package

 $package = File::Package->is_package_loaded($package)
 $error   = File::Package->load_package($package)
 $error   = File::Package->load_package($package, @import)

 ###### 
 # Class Interface - Add File::Package to another class
 #
 use File::Package
 use vars qw(@ISA)
 @ISA = qw(File::Package)

 $package = __PACKAGE__->is_package_loaded($package)
 $error   = __PACKAGE__->load_package($package)
 $error   = __PACKAGE__->load_package($package, @import)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<load_package> method attempts to capture any load problems by
loading the package with a "require " under an eval and capturing
all the "warn" and $@ messages. 
The I<@import> is optional and causes the load package messages
to import the symbols named by I<@import>.

One very useful application is in test scripts. 
If a package does load, it is very helpful that the program does
not die and reports the reason the package did not load. 
This information is readily available when loaded at a local site.
However, it the load occurs at a remote site and the load crashes
Perl, the remote tester usually will not have this information
readily available. 

If using it in a test script with the
'Test' module, be sure to use two arguments 
(2nd argument must be defined, not 0, not '')
for &Test::ok; 
otherwise the &Test::ok will not output the
the actual and expected in the failure error report.
For example,

 use Test;
 use File::Package qw(load_package);
 my $load_error = load_package($package_name);
 ok(!$load_error, 1);

 # skip rests of the tests unless $load_error eq ''

Other applications include using backup alternative software
if a package does not load. For example if the package
'Compress::Zlib' did not load, an attempt may be made
to use the gzip system command. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_package_loaded method

 $package = File::Package->is_package_loaded($package)

The I<is_package_loaded> method determines if a package
vocabulary is present.

For example, if I<File::Basename> is not loaded

 ==> File::Package->is_package_loaded('File::Basename')

=head1 QUALITY ASSURANCE

Running the test script 'Package.t' found in
the "File-Package-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file verifies
the requirements for this module.

All testing software and documentation
stems from the 
Software Test Description (L<STD|Docs::US_DOD::STD>)
program module 't::File::Package',
found in the distribution file 
"File-Package-$VERSION.tar.gz". 

The 't::File::Package' L<STD|Docs::US_DOD::STD> POD contains
a tracebility matix between the
requirements established above for this module, and
the test steps identified by a
'ok' number from running the 'Package.t'
test script.

The t::File::Package' L<STD|Docs::US_DOD::STD>
program module '__DATA__' section contains the data 
to perform the following:

=over 4

=item *

to generate the test script 'Package.t'

=item *

generate the tailored 
L<STD|Docs::US_DOD::STD> POD in
the 't::File::Package' module, 

=item *

generate the 'Package.d' demo script, 

=item *

replace the POD demonstration section
herein with the demo script
'Package.d' output, and

=item *

run the test script using Test::Harness
with or without the verbose option,

=back

To perform all the above, prepare
and run the automation software as 
follows:

=over 4

=item *

Install "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz"
from one of the respositories only
if it has not been installed:

=over 4

=item *

http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

=item *

http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

=back
  
=item *

manually place the script tmake.pl
in "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in
the site operating system executable 
path only if it is not in the 
executable path

=item *

place the 't::File::Package' at the same
level in the directory struture as the
directory holding the 'File::Package'
module

=item *

execute the following in any directory:

 tmake -test_verbose -replace -run -pm=t::File::Package

=back

=head1 NOTES

=head2 FILES

The installation of the
"File-Package-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file
installs the 'Docs::Site_SVD::File_Package'
L<SVD|Docs::US_DOD::SVD> program module.

The __DATA__ data section of the 
'Docs::Site_SVD::File_Package' contains all
the necessary data to generate the POD
section of 'Docs::Site_SVD::File_Package' and
the "File-Package-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file.

To make use of the 
'Docs::Site_SVD::File_Package'
L<SVD|Docs::US_DOD::SVD> program module,
perform the following:

=over 4

=item *

install "ExtUtils-SVDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz"
from one of the respositories only
if it has not been installed:

=over 4

=item *

http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

=item *

http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

=back

=item *

manually place the script vmake.pl
in "ExtUtils-SVDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in
the site operating system executable 
path only if it is not in the 
executable path

=item *

Make any appropriate changes to the
__DATA__ section of the 'Docs::Site_SVD::File_Package'
module.
For example, any changes to
'File::Package' will impact the
at least 'Changes' field.

=item *

Execute the following:

 vmake readme_html all -pm=Docs::Site_SVD::File_Package
