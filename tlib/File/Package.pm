=head1 NAME

File::Package - test load a program module with a package of the same name

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use File::Package

  $package       = File::Package->is_package_loaded($package)
  $error         = File::Package->load_package($package)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One very useful test of the installation of a package is whether
or not the package loaded.
If it did not load, the reason it did not load is helpful
diagnostics.

This information is readily available when loaded at a local site.
However, it the load occurs at a remote site and the load crashes
Perl, the remote tester usually will not have this information
readily available.

The load_package method attempts to capture any load problems by
loading the package with a "require " under an eval and capturing
all the "warn" and $@ messages.
The error messages are returned so that they may be appropriately
tested and if not as expected the actual and expected included
in failure report back to the author of the package.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_package_loaded method

 $package = File::Package->is_package_loaded($package)

The I<is_package_loaded> method determines if a package
vocabulary is present.

For example, if I<File::Basename> is not loaded

 ==> File::Package->is_package_loaded('File::Basename')
