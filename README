1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification
    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview
    The 'Tie::Gzip' module provides a file handle Tie for compressing and
    uncompressing files using the gzip format.

    By tieing a filehandle to 'Tie::Gzip' subsequent uses of the file
    subroutines with the tied filehandle will compress data written to an
    opened file using gzip compression and decompress data read from an
    opened file using gzip compression.

    If the 'Tie::Gzip' tie receives a *filename* or *mode filename* after
    completing the tie, 'Tie::Gzip' will open *filename*.

    During the tie, Tie::Gzip will first try to load the 'Compress::Zlib'
    module and package. If successful, 'Tie::Gzip' uses the 'Compress::Zlib'
    for compressing and decompressing the file data.

    If unsuccessful, 'Tie::Gzip' setups up the following pipes to an
    anticipated GNU 'gzip' site command for compressing and decompressing
    the file data:

     gzip --decompress --stdout {} | # read file data
     | gzip --stdout > {} # write file data

    where the string '{}' is a placeholder for the *filename*.

  1.3 Document overview.

    the inventory, installation instructions and other information necessary
    to utilize and track this release.
